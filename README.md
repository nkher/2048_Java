2048_Java
=========

This repository contains the code to the 2048 game built completely in Java.

The game is tried to be built using object oriented principles, with the main entities or objects being 
the GameContainer (Main Game board) and Block (Tiles) as the blocks in them. Other classes are either starter
or helper classes. Appropriate methods and instance variables have been given to each of the classes and the naming 
is self explanatory, however suggestions are welcome.
